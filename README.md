# HandyAI

The marketplace for AI tools. Compare 39 platforms by price across monthly, quarterly and annual
plans, get picks for your profession, ask the AI Chat (typed or spoken), and track every AI
subscription you pay for in one place.

- `backend/handy-ai` — Spring Boot 4.1 REST API (Java 17, JPA, H2 locally, MySQL in production)
- `frontend` — React 19 + Vite single page app, deployable to Vercel

## Running it

Two terminals. The backend first.

```bash
cd backend/handy-ai
./mvnw spring-boot:run          # Windows: mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

It starts on <http://localhost:8080> with an in-memory H2 database and seeds 13 categories and
39 tools on first run. Nothing to install or configure.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is on <http://localhost:5173>. The dev server proxies `/api` to port 8080, and it listens
on the network too, so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can open `http://<your-ip>:5173` and see the
mobile layout.

Demo account: `demo@handyai.app` / `demo12345` (the sign-in page can fill it in for you). It is
only created locally; the production profile turns it off.

### The admin account

There is exactly one admin, set by `handyai.admin.email` (default
`syedibrahimahmed.dev@gmail.com`). On every start the backend creates that account if it is
missing, gives it the configured password, and removes the admin role from anyone else. The
admin's **Admin dashboard** (account menu → `/admin`) shows live users, purchase redirects,
registrations and tracked subscriptions, refreshing every 5 seconds, plus organisation
verification.

The password is never committed. Locally, create `backend/handy-ai/config/application.properties`
(git-ignored) containing:

```properties
handyai.admin.password=your-password
```

In production set the `HANDYAI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable instead.

### Using MySQL instead

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE handyai CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;"
cd backend/handy-ai
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
```

Connection details come from `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_DB`, `MYSQL_USER` and
`MYSQL_PASSWORD`, all with sensible localhost defaults — see
`src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties`. The seeder is idempotent, so restarting against
a persistent database inserts only what is missing.

### Tests

```bash
cd backend/handy-ai && ./mvnw test
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Deploying

Vercel hosts the frontend only; it cannot run the Java backend. Put the backend on a host that
runs Docker (Render, Railway, Fly.io) with a MySQL database, then point the frontend at it.

**1. Backend** — deploy `backend/handy-ai` with its `Dockerfile` (it runs the `prod` profile) and
set these environment variables. The app refuses to start if a required one is missing.

| Variable | Required | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HANDYAI_JWT_SECRET` | yes | 32+ random characters, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48` |
| `HANDYAI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes | The admin's password |
| `HANDYAI_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | yes | Your Vercel URL(s), comma separated, e.g. `https://handyai.vercel.app` |
| `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | yes | From your MySQL provider |
| `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_DB`, `MYSQL_SSL_MODE` | no | Default `3306`, `handyai`, `REQUIRED` |
| `HANDYAI_ADMIN_EMAIL` | no | Defaults to `syedibrahimahmed.dev@gmail.com` |

Check it with `https://<backend>/api/health`.

**2. Frontend** — import the repo in Vercel with **Root Directory** `frontend` (the included
`vercel.json` sets the build and makes page refreshes work on every route) and add the
environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://<backend>/api`. Redeploy after changing it: Vite
bakes it in at build time.

**What "live" means here.** Live users are browser tabs that sent a heartbeat in the last 75
seconds, kept in the backend's memory, so run a single backend instance (or move presence to
Redis before scaling out). A purchase redirect is a click on Buy / Try it, recorded as HandyAI
hands the visitor to the vendor; the payment itself happens on the vendor's site and is not
reported back without an affiliate programme.

## API

Everything lives under `/api`. Browsing is public; anything tied to a person needs
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` from register or login.

| Method | Path | Auth | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/register` | — | Create an account, returns a token |
| POST | `/auth/login` | — | Sign in, returns a token |
| GET | `/auth/me` | yes | The signed-in profile |
| PUT | `/auth/me` | yes | Update name / profession |
| GET | `/tools` | optional | Search with `q`, `category`, `pricing`, `sort`, `page`, `size` |
| GET | `/tools/featured`, `/tools/trending` | optional | Home page rails |
| GET | `/tools/{slug}` | optional | One tool |
| GET | `/tools/{slug}/reviews` | — | Reviews for a tool |
| PUT | `/tools/{slug}/reviews` | yes | Add or replace your review (1–5 plus a comment) |
| DELETE | `/tools/{slug}/reviews/{id}` | yes | Remove your own review |
| POST | `/tools/{slug}/favorite` | yes | Toggle saved, returns the new state |
| GET | `/me/favorites` | yes | Your saved tools |
| GET | `/categories`, `/categories/{slug}` | — | Categories with tool counts |
| POST | `/recommendations` | optional | The matcher: `goal`, `profession`, `categorySlugs`, `pricing`, `limit` |
| GET | `/stats`, `/health` | — | Counters and a liveness check |
| GET | `/tools/price-ranges` | — | Marketplace price bands with counts, per `currency` |
| GET | `/professions` | — | The 60 professions and 25 industries for sign-up |
| POST | `/chat` | optional | One AI Chat turn: `message` plus the `context` from the last reply |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/me/subscriptions` | yes | Track, edit and remove your subscriptions |
| POST | `/presence` | optional | Heartbeat behind the live-users count |
| GET | `/go/{slug}` | — | Records a purchase redirect, then 302s to the vendor |
| GET | `/admin/stats` | admin | Live dashboard numbers |
| GET/POST | `/admin/organisations…` | admin | List, approve and reject organisations |

Signing in only sharpens the results: a token adds your saved flag to every card and nudges
recommendations towards the categories you favourite and rate highly.

Errors always come back in one shape, so the frontend has a single path to handle:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T09:10:41Z",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Enter a valid email address",
  "path": "/api/auth/register",
  "fieldErrors": { "email": "Enter a valid email address" }
}
```

## How the backend is put together

```
com.handyai.build
├── config        WebConfig (CORS), CatalogueSeeder
├── controller    Auth, Tool, Category, Favorite, Recommendation, Meta
├── domain        User, Category, AiTool, Review, Favorite, Role, PricingModel
├── dto           Request/response records — entities never leave the service layer
├── exception     Typed failures + GlobalExceptionHandler
├── repository    Spring Data JPA interfaces
├── security      PasswordHasher (PBKDF2), JwtService (HS256), filter, CurrentUserProvider
└── service       AuthService, ToolService, CategoryService, ReviewService,
                  FavoriteService, RecommendationService
```

Deliberate choices that keep concurrent requests out of each other's way:

- **No bidirectional relations.** Every `@ManyToOne` is lazy and nothing owns a collection, so a
  read is one predictable query and JSON can never recurse.
- **`spring.jpa.open-in-view=false`.** The persistence session closes when the service call
  returns, so no request holds a pooled connection while the response is being written.
- **Fixed lock order on writes.** A review is written before the tool row it belongs to, always in
  that order, so two reviews on the same tool queue instead of dead-locking.
- **Ratings are re-derived, not incremented.** After any review write the sum and count come from
  an aggregate query, so interleaved transactions cannot lose an update.
- **Stateless auth.** JWTs mean no server-side session map to synchronise on.
- **Unique constraints backed by a handler.** A duplicate email or double-tapped favourite comes
  back as a clean `409` instead of a `500`.

Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (210k iterations, per-user salt) using the JDK only.
Set `HANDYAI_JWT_SECRET` (32+ characters) in any environment that is not your laptop.
